<p>
	During the summer of 2023, I worked on Physics-Informed Machine Learning at <a href="https://mila.quebec/">MILA</a> 
	under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://www.siamak.page/">Siamak Ravanbakhsh</a> and in collaboration 
	with <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/person/tara-akhound-sadegh/">Tara Akhound-Sadegh</a>. This work was 
	funded by an undergraduate research award (SURA).
</p>

<p>
	In particular, our work involved Operator Learning for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), and 
	Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). The combined framework of operator learning with PINNs allows one 
	to learn the solution operator of PDEs without the need of simulation data for training, and enables solving 
	PDEs with different initial or boundary conditions, or coefficients.
</p>

<p>
	We developed a new transformer-based model for this paradigm, called Physics-Informed Transformer (PIT), 
	which is invariant to the discretization of its input domain and shows significant improvements when 
	compared to other standard architectures.

<h3 style="margin-bottom:0pt;">MATH 410 - Major's Research Project</h3>

<img src="./Documents/math410-img.png" alt="DFA for WP(D3)" style="float:right;max-width:30%;">

<p>
	During the winter 2023 semester, I undertook a research project under the supervision of Dr. 
	<a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/mathstat/jeremy-macdonald">Jeremy Macdonald</a> and Prof. 
	<a href="https://www.math.mcgill.ca/msabok/">Marcin Sabok</a>.
</p>

<p>
	In this project, I studied a
	fundamental problem lying at the intersection of combinatorial group theory and computability 
	theory: the word problem for groups. In particular, I studied the connections between group 
	theoretic properties of a group, and language theoretic properties of its word problem.
</p>

<p>
	The 
	survey paper I wrote for the project can be found <a href="./Documents/math410.pdf">here</a>,
	and the slides to my end-of-term presentation can be found <a href="./Documents/slides.pdf">here</a>.
