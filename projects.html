<h3 style="margin-bottom:0pt;">Truth Table Generator</h3>

<p>
	A <a href="https://fabricioperazzo.github.io/truth-table/">webpage</a> to generate truth tables of 
	propositional formulas. In this project, I used JavaScript to implement a parser for propositional 
	logic and to evaluate a formula by generating its truth table. The website supports the standard 
	connectives, such as negation, conjunction, disjunction and implication, and allows for an arbitrary 
	number of propositional variables.

<h3 style="margin-bottom:0pt;">Hitomezashi Patterns</h3>

<img id="hitomezashi" src="./Documents/hitomezashi.png" alt="Hitomezashi Stitch Pattern">

<p>
	Hitomezashi is a type of sashiko stitching, a traditional japanese embroidery technique used to mend or 
	decorate cloth and clothing. Hitomezashi is completed by stitching regularly on a grid, one running stitch 
	per grid spacing which alternates on the front and the back of the cloth. 
</p>

<p>
	One way of generating a hitomezashi pattern is by considering two binary strings. The first string gives the
	state (present or not) of the first stitch in the verical lines in order, and the second string does the same
	for the horizontal lines. For example, the pattern depicted here has a vertical string starting with 1110111...
	and horizontal string starting with 1000111... 
</p>

<p>
	In this project, I wrote a python script which generates two random binary strings and draws the corresponding 
	hitomezashi pattern. The script can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/FabricioPerazzo/fabricioperazzo.github.io">GitHub</a>,
	and an interesting paper by Katherine Seaton and Carol Hayes about the mathematical properties of hitomezashi designs can be found
